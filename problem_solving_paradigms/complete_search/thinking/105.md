- Identify if a building is hidden by another or not.

  ```
  c = "current building"
  n = "next building"
  p = "previous building"
  isHidden = false

  // Is hidden by previous building.
  if(c.left < p.right && c.height < p.height)
  {
    isHidden = true
    c = c + 1;
  }

  // Next building is away from current.
  if(n.left > c.right)
    c = c + 1


  ```

- You need a way to not identify where a building is hidden by another:

  ```
  travel = vector<int>;
  size = buildings.size();

  for(int i = 1; i < size; i++)
  {
    current = buildings[i]; // Building with no distance of separation to the next building.

    // Do the following until reach a no-hidden building but closely to the current one.
    for(int j = i + 1; j < size || ; j++)
    {
      current = buildings[i]; // Building with no distance of separation to the next building.
      next = buildings[j];

      buildingsAreSeparated = next.left > current.right;
      if(buildingsAreSeparated)
        break;

      exceedsCurrentRange = next.right > current.right
      exceedsCurrentHeight = next.height > current.height;

      // Add to the vector the next coordinates (start and end points).
      if(exceedsCurrentRange)
      {
        // Start points.
        path.push_back(current.right);
        path.push_back(next.height);

        // End points.
        path.push_back()
        // TODO: view what happens in the following iteration
      }
      else if(exceedsCurrentHeight)
      {
        // Start points.
        path.push_back(next.left);
        path.push_back(next.height);

        // End points.
        path.push_back(next.right);
        path.push_back(current.height);
      }
      else
      {
        // Start points.
        path.push_back(current.left);
        path.push_back(current.height);

        // End points.
        path.push_back(current.right);
        path.push_back(0);
      }

      i++;
    }

    // TODO: Add last coordinates.
  }
  ```

- Do de process of avoiding searching hidden buildings.

  1. Secuential serie of progressive more large buildings and not taller than the processing one but all greater in range of the one in process.
  2. Appears a new one that is larger in range and height and is in the range of the processing one and exceeds the range of the last one before it.
  3. It's possible to avoid the registered buildings in the skyline vector without analizing them and only knowing the information about the processing one and the current one?
    The answer is: ?
  4. There are two fur results.
    - The first where the new buildings are:
      - *smaller* than the processing one.
      - *starts in the range* of the processing one and each one
      - *exceeds the range of the previous one*.

      Conclusion: The new building together witht he processing one, hide the other buildings.

    - The second where:
      - the new buildings has *irregular height*,
      - *starts in the range* of the processing one
      - *exceeds the range of the previous one*.

      Conclusion:  The new building together with the processing one probably does not hide the other buildings.

    - The third where:
      
      Conclusion: The new building is like the other previous buildings.

    - The fourth where:

      Conclusion: Th enew building hide partially the previous ones.

- Some things:

  - Keep the higher and larger building inside the height and range of the processing one, respectively
  - If the tracked previous one (in the step before) is smaller and has less range than the new one:
    - Replace their representation in the skyline for the reference of the new one. That means:
      - 

- How to know if a building is separated from a building or a grouped buildings.

  - Know if a Building is separated from another:

    ```
    p = "previos buildign"
    n = "next building"
    bool isSeparated = n.left > p.right
    ```
  - Know if a building is separated of a group of buildings.

    ```
    c = "current building"
    p = "previous building"
    n = "next building"
    ```

- Identify if a building is hidden by another or not.

  ```
  c = "current building"
  n = "next building"
  p = "previous building"
  isHidden = false

  // Is hidden by previous building.
  if(c.left < p.right && c.height < p.height)
  {
    isHidden = true
    c = c + 1;
  }

  // Next building is away from current.
  if(n.left > c.right)
    c = c + 1


  ```

- You need a way to not identify where a building is hidden by another:

  ```
  travel = vector<int>;
  size = buildings.size();

  for(int i = 1; i < size; i++)
  {
    current = buildings[i]; // Building with no distance of separation to the next building.

    // Do the following until reach a no-hidden building but closely to the current one.
    for(int j = i + 1; j < size || ; j++)
    {
      current = buildings[i]; // Building with no distance of separation to the next building.
      next = buildings[j];

      buildingsAreSeparated = next.left > current.right;
      if(buildingsAreSeparated)
        break;

      exceedsCurrentRange = next.right > current.right
      exceedsCurrentHeight = next.height > current.height;

      // Add to the vector the next coordinates (start and end points).
      if(exceedsCurrentRange)
      {
        // Start points.
        path.push_back(current.right);
        path.push_back(next.height);

        // TODO: view what happens in the following iteration
      }
      else if(exceedsCurrentHeight)
      {
        // Start points.
        path.push_back(next.left);
        path.push_back(next.height);

        // End points.
        path.push_back(next.right);
        path.push_back(current.height);
      }
      else
      {
        // Start points.
        path.push_back(current.left);
        path.push_back(current.height);

        // End points.
        path.push_back(current.right);
        path.push_back(0);
      }

      i++;
    }
  }
  ```
